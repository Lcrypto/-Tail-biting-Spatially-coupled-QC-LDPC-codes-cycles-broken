# -Tail-biting-Spatially-coupled-QC-LDPC-codes-cycles-broken
The GitHub repository contains an implementation for constructing Tail-bitted Spatially-Coupled QC-LDPC codes, which are LDPC codes with cycle breaking based on structures of protograph shifts. This implementation is based on the work by A. Jimenez Felstrom and K. Sh. Zigangirov, "Time-varying periodic convolutional codes with low-density parity-check matrices," published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory in 1999.

Tail-bitting is a technique used to convert an infinite-length convolutional code into a block code that can be decoded using iterative decoding techniques. Spatially-coupled LDPC codes are known for their excellent error-correction performance and have been used in many practical applications.

This repository provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in constructing efficient error-correction systems using tail-bitted spatially-coupled QC-LDPC codes. The implementation is based on well-regarded research, making it a valuable tool for those exploring ways to improve the error-correction performance of communication systems.

Overall, this repository offers a comprehensive implementation for constructing tail-bitted spatially-coupled QC-LDPC codes based on structures of protograph shifts. Researchers and practitioners will find this implementation valuable in exploring various strategies for designing efficient error-correction systems with high-performance rates.
